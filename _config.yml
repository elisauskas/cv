 Hi ðŸ‘‹, 
  
  I am a Site Reliability Engineer who is inspired by open-minded professionals and motivated by progress, efficiency, and results. 
  As well as administrating systems I also have experience defining infrastructure as a code, monitoring, and setting up CI/CD. 
  I have worked at a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills, so would fit into Site Reliability Engineer, 
  Systems Architect or Cloud Architect/Consultant roles.
